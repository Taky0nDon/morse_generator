# Morse Code Generator

## Project goal

This is a text-based tool to convert strings into morse code

## Start

Created a dictionary where the keys are the possible values of the original string (a-z) (0-9),
and the values are the morse equivalent.
Successfully able to convert strings to morse code.

#TODO
* Enable reverse conversion. Should be easy to create another dict with the keys and values of the first dict reversed.
* allow command line arguments
